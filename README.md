# Movie Browser (React + React Router)

A beginner React project built in a team by **Arta** and **Iris**.

We use **The Movie Database (TMDB)** API to fetch movies, show them in a list, and open a **movie detail page** when you click a movie.

## What we are learning
- Building a multi-page app using **React Router**
- Using URL parameters (like a **movie id**) to load dynamic content
- Using APIs with **useState** + **useEffect**
- Making a responsive and accessible UI

## Features
- Movie list page (example: popular movies)
- Movie detail page (dynamic route)
- Responsive design (mobile to desktop)
- Accessibility improvements (alt text, contrast, semantic HTML)

## Tech stack
- React
- React Router
- TMDB API
- Vite
- CSS (styled-components)
